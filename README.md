# Sort Visualizer

This is a GUI-based educational tool to provide a controllable simulation/visualization of a few popular sorting algorithms. A menu screen provides a selection of algorithms to view, and the simulation screen shows the algorithm in action while allowing the user to control the simulation speed.

This project is a "redux" of an old project I created to help myself study while taking a course on data structures & algorithms. This time around I tried to make it more informative, user-friendly, and easier on the eyes.

## Algorithms supported
So far, the algorithms implemented in this tool are:
- **O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithms**
    - [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
    - [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
    - [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
- **O(n log n) algorithms**
    - [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
    - [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
    - [Shell sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort)
- **Non-comparison based algorithms**
    - [Counting sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort)
    - [Radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort) (LSD)
- **Others**
    - [Slow sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowsort)
